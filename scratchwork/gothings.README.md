ADVICE:

**This project is under construction.**  

Project documentation is sparse and not reliable, owing to the on-going (re-)definition of many secondary aspects of the project.  
Owing to the above, please be aware it may be next-to-impossible to use this repository to make any useful work.  

Anyway, the original work included may be used according to the permissible MIT License.
